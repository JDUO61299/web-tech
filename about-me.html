                <h2>Jordan Duo </h2>
                <p>I was born and bred in a little british colony called Gibraltar, located at the most southern tip of Spain. I always had a huge interest in computers and any other digital devices I could get my hands on. I think my love for technology mostly stemmed from my passion for gaming. I would spend countless hours sat on my grandmother's bed playing all sorts of my dad's old consoles. This really gave me an insight into how technology had evolved over the years, and made me curious as to what the limits could be. Fast forward about 13 years, and now I am studying I.T. Management at Solent University where I am developing my understanding for the industry I love so much.</p>
